# This are documented here: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks/internal/checks.yaml
# Checks need to be explicitly defined. AllStar already calls scorecard 
# Binary-Artifacts, and Dangerous-Workflow
# and has its own implementation of Branch-Protection

# The other Critical or High checks are
# - Code-Review, Dependency-Update-Tool, Maintained
# - Signed-Releases, Token-Permissions, Vulnerabilities
# - Webhooks (experimental)
checks: # AllStar already call scorecard for Binary-Artifacts, Branch-Protection,
